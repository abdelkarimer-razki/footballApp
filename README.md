Web App: API Integration with Express.js and Angular
Welcome to the GitHub repository for my first web application, where I explore API integration using Express.js and Angular. This project aims to demonstrate the process of building a web application that communicates with an external API, utilizing the power of Express.js on the server side and Angular on the client side.

Features
API Integration: Learn how to connect your web app with external APIs and fetch data to display in your application.
Express.js Backend: Utilize Express.js, a fast and minimalist web application framework, to handle API requests and serve data to the client.
Angular Frontend: Leverage Angular, a powerful TypeScript-based framework, to create a responsive and interactive user interface.
RESTful Architecture: Follow best practices in designing your application by implementing a RESTful API architecture.
Authentication and Authorization: Implement user authentication and authorization mechanisms to secure your application.
Error Handling: Learn how to handle errors gracefully and provide meaningful feedback to users.
Routing: Implement client-side routing using Angular's router module to create a seamless navigation experience.
